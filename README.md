# Data-Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is the process of cleaning, organizing, and transforming raw data before it's analyzed or used in a model.

* Cleaning: Removing incorrect, irrelevant, or incomplete data, and handling missing values 
* Organizing: Structuring the data to make it easier to analyze 
* Transforming: Modifying the data to make it more suitable for analysis and modeling 

Data preprocessing is an important step in the data mining process and can improve the accuracy and efficiency of downstream analysis and modeling.

In this Repository i have cleaned raw dataset, handle missing values, convert categoriacal data into numeric,  removing inconsistency in dataset and turn big raw data into clean readable data.
